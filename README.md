# Bank Fraud Prediction Project using Tree-based Models
#### Skills
+ Data science workflow
+ XGBoost, random forest, decision tree

This is a school project I did as part of one of my analytics courses, where I took a bank dataset from kaggle and used data to predict which customers where most likely to commit fraud based on the data. This project was one of my introductions to the data science workflow, turning a dataset and a high-impact question into a machine learning model and using the model outputs to help answer the question.
